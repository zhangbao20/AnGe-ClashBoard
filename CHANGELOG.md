# Changelog

## [1.86](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.85...v1.86) (2026-06-12)

### Bug Fixes

* keep managed rule-source syncing from dropping providers during single or bulk rule refreshes, and report missing provider source URLs explicitly

## [1.85](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.84...v1.85) (2026-04-03)

### Bug Fixes

* let strategy penetration keep following the manually clicked child selector path in fallback chains so you can still drill into selector groups and switch to an available node even when the runtime route temporarily falls back to an auto url-test branch

## [1.84](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.83...v1.84) (2026-04-03)

### Bug Fixes

* restore true content-driven sizing for the connections table in auto width mode so each column expands with its actual content instead of being constrained by fixed column widths and truncation rules

## [1.83](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.82...v1.83) (2026-04-03)

### Bug Fixes

* fix the top-right expand/collapse action on the proxy page so it correctly controls the active render state in both the node and provider tabs, including provider category mode

## [1.82](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.81...v1.82) (2026-03-31)

### Bug Fixes

* refine the icon-settings custom icon section by restoring the original visual style, enlarging the effective click target without changing the overall look, removing duplicate collapse arrows, tightening tab height and font weight, and aligning the expand/collapse control size and hover feedback with the surrounding action buttons

## [1.81](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.80...v1.81) (2026-03-31)

### Bug Fixes

* refine the connections table layout by restoring reliable header/body alignment, tightening the compact column spacing, keeping grouped type and source-IP labels readable, restoring the header divider, and returning the close icon size to the expected appearance

## [1.80](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.79...v1.80) (2026-03-31)

### Features

* allow text selection and right-click copying in the connections table without opening rows by mistake
* align domain penetration tables with the connections table style, including zebra rows and tighter row height
* keep domain penetration header corners stable while scrolling and remove the stray rounded bottom corners on selected rows

* refine proxy group domain-penetration action hover colors for both light and dark themes

## [1.79](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.78...v1.79) (2026-03-30)

### Bug Fixes

* fix a critical password-access bug by keeping password edits in a local draft until blur or Enter, preventing half-entered passwords from immediately replacing the saved login password and forcing users back to the login screen

## [1.78](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.77...v1.78) (2026-03-30)

### Bug Fixes

## [1.77](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.76...v1.77) (2026-03-30)

### Bug Fixes

* nudge the icon-settings title downward so the `icon` heading sits more naturally alongside the custom-icon label and collapse control
* keep the icon-settings header row vertically centered while preserving the compact tab layout below

## [1.76](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.75...v1.76) (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

* move the mobile icon-settings title, custom-icon label, and expand action onto one line while keeping the strategy, node, and other tabs compact underneath

## [1.75](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.74...v1.75) (2026-03-29)

### Bug Fixes

* refine the mobile proxy provider toolbar by moving the refresh action onto the second row, letting the search field resize more naturally, and keeping the action icons right-aligned on subscription screens

## [1.74](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.73...v1.74) (2026-03-29)

### Features

* restructure mobile pages so top toolbars sit above their own scroll areas, keeping the right-side scrollbar below the toolbar and aligning page gutters more consistently

### Bug Fixes

* restore the top visible content area for mobile logs, large rule lists, and connection card lists so the first items are no longer hidden behind the toolbar
* tighten the mobile proxy toolbar by shrinking the mode selector and preserving a cleaner right gutter for the latency-test action icons
* increase the top gap under the mobile settings menu so the first settings panel matches the app-wide spacing rhythm

## [1.73](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.72...v1.73) (2026-03-29)

### Features

* refine proxy group and preview spacing to improve readability in dense policy lists

## [1.64](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.63...v1.64) (2026-03-23)

### Features

* refreshing rule caches now syncs the managed `data/rule-source.yaml` to the latest built-in `rule-providers`, and background auto-refresh checks run periodically while still respecting each provider `interval`

### Refactors

* reduce the managed `data/rule-source.yaml` to a minimal runtime file that keeps only the `rule-providers` section used by the local rule cache

## [1.63](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.62...v1.63) (2026-03-23)

### Bug Fixes

* prefer current YAML rule-provider URLs in rule lookups, normalize malformed proxy-prefixed source links, and restore the rule-source copy button with an HTTP-safe fallback
* switch `Claude / Domain` to the maintained `liandu2024/clash` source so lookup results show the updated provider URL

## [1.62](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.61...v1.62) (2026-03-23)

### Features

* rank keyword-based rule lookups by relevance, show up to 10 matched lines per rule set, and add a clear reminder that only the 10 most relevant lines are displayed

### Bug Fixes

* limit the two-column proxy layout to the policy tab so node and subscription views stay in a single-column layout even when the setting is enabled
* bundle the Linux `mihomo` binary in the repository so Linux source runs can parse `.mrs` rule providers without manual setup

## [1.61](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.60...v1.61) (2026-03-23)

### Bug Fixes

* make proxy-page single-column and two-column layouts mutually exclusive so policy and subscription cards no longer render a duplicated extra list

## [1.60](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.52...v1.60) (2026-03-23)

### Features

* add proxy domain grouping and rule-penetration views so policy groups can drill into matched domain, IP, and port rules with source filtering
* surface rule-set total counts in rule lookups and restore full rule-cache refresh coverage for both text and `.mrs` providers

### Bug Fixes

* tighten desktop proxy-page spacing, align panel gutters, and make rule-penetration tabs size to their labels instead of stretching too wide
* close domain-group dropdowns on outside click, use pointer cursors for menu items, and simplify connection details so only the effective matched strategy remains
* clear stale PWA service workers and cached assets during startup so upgraded builds no longer stay stuck on old front-end bundles

## [1.52](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.51...v1.52) (2026-03-21)

### Bug Fixes

## [1.51](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.50...v1.51) (2026-03-21)

### Bug Fixes

* align strategy-group proxy card bottom spacing with the card side padding, including expanded penetration views
* rebalance dot-preview spacing so top-level previews stay more relaxed while wildcard-category headers keep tighter, consistent title-to-dot spacing

## [1.50](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.43...v1.50) (2026-03-21)

### Features

* sync provider wildcard categories into node-group and strategy-group views, including grouped dot previews, category-level collapse/expand, and per-category latency tests
* keep wildcard-category enablement consistent across provider, node-group, and strategy-group views so disabling a provider category immediately removes the grouped view everywhere

### Bug Fixes

* restore expected provider header interactions so provider cards and wildcard-category sections toggle correctly between expanded nodes and collapsed dot previews
* unify grouped-header, dot-preview, strategy-penetration, and card-bottom spacing for a more consistent proxy layout

## [1.43](https://github.com/liandu2024/AnGe-ClashBoard/compare/v1.42...v1.43) (2026-03-20)

* refresh proxy status displays on related page and tab switches, then schedule conservative follow-up refreshes from Clash history timing

### Bug Fixes

* keep update animations spinning on the icon only instead of rotating the whole button background
* align mobile horizontal spacing across policy, node, and provider tabs
* scale iPhone mobile UI closer to Android for more consistent visual density
